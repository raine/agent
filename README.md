The Timber Agent is a cross-platform natively-compiled utility for capturing log data
(file & STDIN) and sending it to Timber.io. It is designed to be light weight, highly efficient,
and reliable without the need for dependencies.

## Installation

1. Download the archive for your architecture:

    ```shell
    curl -LO {{choose-url-below}}
    ```

    * [Darwin AMD64 latest](https://packages.timber.io/agent/0.x.x/darwin-amd64/timber-agent-0.x.x-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
    * [FreeBSD AMD64 latest](https://packages.timber.io/agent/0.x.x/freebsd-amd64/timber-agent-0.x.x-freebsd-amd64.tar.gz)
    * [Linux AMD64 latest](https://packages.timber.io/agent/0.x.x/linux-amd64/timber-agent-0.x.x-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
    * [Netbsd AMD64 latest](https://packages.timber.io/agent/0.x.x/netbsd-amd64/timber-agent-0.x.x-netbsd-amd64.tar.gz)
    * [Openbsd AMD64 latest](https://packages.timber.io/agent/0.x.x/openbsd-amd64/timber-agent-0.x.x-openbsd-amd64.tar.gz)

    All releases can be found [here](https://github.com/timberio/agent/releases). Special URLs that point to the current releases can be found [here](https://timber.io/docs/platforms/other/agent/versioning).

2. Unpack the archive to a common location like `/opt`:

    ```shell
    tar -xzf timber-agent-0.x.x-darwin-amd64.tar.gz -C /opt
    ```

    The agent will be located at `/opt/timber-agent/bin/timber-agent`.

3. Move the `timber.toml` file to `/etc`:

    ```shell
    cp /opt/timber-agent/support/config/timber.basic.toml /etc/timber.toml
    ```

4. In `/etc/timber.toml` replace `MY_TIMBER_API_KEY` with your API key. [*Don't have a key?*](https://timber.io/docs/app/applications/obtaining-api-key)

    ```shell
    sed -i 's/MY_TIMBER_API_KEY/{{my-timber-api-key}}/g' /etc/timber.toml
    ```

    *Be sure to replace `{{my-timber-api-key}}` in the command above with your _actual_ API key.*

5. In `/etc/timber.toml` update the `[[files]]` entries to forward your chosen files.

6. Start the `timber-agent`:

    ```shell
    /opt/timber-agent/bin/timber-agent capture-files
    ```

    Checkout the [usage section](#usage) as well as the [startup scripts directory](https://github.com/timberio/agent/tree/master/support/scripts/startup) to assist with starting and stopping the agent.


#### How it works

The agent will start in the foreground and begin capturing any new data written to
the specified files.

The agent will also pick up the hostname of your server by default, but you can
explicitly set the hostname you want it to use with your logs by providing
a `hostname` key at the top of the file:

```toml
hostname = "worker-a.us-east-1.example.com"
```

See [configuration](#configuration) below for more details.
