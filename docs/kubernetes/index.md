# Kubernetes

With Timber's Kubernetes integration, you can seamlessly deliver logs from pods in your [Kubernetes] Cluster to your
Timber account. These logs are shipped with supplementary Kubernetes metadata that assists in identifying and grouping
sources such as Pod name, Namespace, Deployment, etc.
